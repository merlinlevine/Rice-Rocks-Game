# Rice-Rocks-Game
Game I made for Rice University's "Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" Coursera course.

This game relies on on the online IDE used during the Coursera course, codeskulptor.org.

To demo the game, copy the contents of the main file into codeskulptor (in a chrome browser preferably) and press the run button.
